hello! 
This is how the code works: 
the first 129 lines of the code establishes what objects are in the room, their sizes and position. I should have it labeled 
via comments of which code deals with what object

lines 135 - 154 deals with the buttons, the visual button you see on the web page and you press. They should also be labeled. 
They are linked to lines 992 - 1039 which actually tell the buttons what to do (i will get into those later) 

lines 162 - 735 contains the image links to all the images that are used in the webpage. They are public image urls that can be accessed 
from any computer. These images have been downloaded, processed to remove the background, then had the links created

lines 738 - 932 contains the actual links to the images present. This is where the code links to when the user double clicks on the object. 
It will take the user to the link associated with the image in a different window 

lines 938 - 948 deals with the adjusting of the room size. When the user inputs a certain number into the length and width boxes, the code 
will take the number and multiply it by 4, then adject the room length accordingly to the amount of pixels resulting.
